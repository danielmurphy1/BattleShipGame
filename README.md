### Summary

This is my first application in my journey of learning C#, which I just started a couple of weeks ago as of the completion of this game. 
This was a lot of fun learning the basics of C# and OOP and putting them into a live project. I learned a lot about classes and the differences between an OOP language such as C# and a functional language like JavaScript.
Also, I learned quite a bit about the built-in debugging feature of Visual Studio. It helped me to sharpen my general debugging skills as well as learning the specific skills in using that technology, which was new to me in making this application.
After creating this project, I feel that I have a good grasp on the basics of OOP and C#, and I am excited to continue to learn more as I move on and develop bigger/more complex projects using C#.
